## Vue.js 3 boilerplate for large-scale projects

This project was developed based on the **Feature Sliced Design** Architectural methodology. This boilerplate demonstrates the proper organization of your frontend project. It offers an easily discoverable architecture through domain scopes, allowing for flexible replacement and addition of architecture components to meet new requirements. Each module can be modified or rewritten independently without causing side effects. The project maintains a balance between DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and local customization, ensuring efficient and effective development.
